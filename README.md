# Cisco-CCNP-Labs
This is a repository where all of the labs that I did while in Cisco CCNP will go.
While in my junior and senior years of high school, I worked on Cisco Networking Academy.
In my junior year, I did CCNA, in my senior year, I did CCNP.
CCNP was all labs, so here is the writeups of every single lab that I did.
The reason why I have "Router 1-5/6 Lab 1/2" is because I wanted to have my router configs
and the rest of my writeup separate. My teacher wanted them together.
That is why the writeups for Lab 3 onward contain no separate router/switch files. They are
all in the main document. This does mean that the main document will go from 2-3 pages
to over 20, but... oh well.
